<!-- oct 11th 
I know the code doesn't look like much but I kinda want to take it slow and understand the code
so when future projects come I can easily remember the layout of html or hopefully have a better understanding
of it. I'm using w3 schools to know element style, attribute, etc. The code will get done this week.
I already got my text and color palette. Right now is tech theme, I may chaneg my mind if I don't have 9 photos related to tech. -->
